# Spam Mail Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict whether an email is spam or not using machine learning techniques. The `SpamMailPrediction.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains the code and analysis required to build, train, and evaluate a spam mail classification model.

## Files

- **SpamMailPrediction.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow for spam mail prediction.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction
- Model training using machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation of model performance
- Predictions on new data

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

 ## Running the Notebook
